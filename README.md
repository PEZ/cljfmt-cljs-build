# Minimal shadow-cljs :node-script and :node-library

This is an attempt to reproduce a problem I have with compiling Calva's `:node-library` with latest `cljfmt`. It doesn't reproduce the problem, though, and can as well be used as an example of how to create a minimal script of library using shadow-cljs.
